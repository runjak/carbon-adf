When a Discussion is fitted to an Instance,
every statement from the instance must be represented as an Item.

Uploaded Instances will identify Items by their Headlines, rather than their Id.
So first a mapping of Headline -> Either ItemId Headline will be performed by looking up headlines in the db,
and than a mapping of Either ItemId Headline -> ItemId will take place, by creating new Items for each Headline.

For every ac, the Item that resembles the head will get new Relations:
 - All current incomming Relations will be dropped
 - New incomming Relations will be drawn of type RelationCustom,
   because from the condition alone we can't infer if it's an attack or a defense
 - New Relations will be drawn to an Item from every Item mentioned in it's ac.
