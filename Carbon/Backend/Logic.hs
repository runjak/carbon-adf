  Generates the condition for an Item by taking into account all it's relations.
  There's three different cases:
  1: Item doesn't have a Condition -> Simple Condition is generated, and case 2 is performed.
  2: Items Condition has a proofStandard -> We generate the Condition by the proofStandard
  3: Items Condition has a formula but no proofStandard -> This is a custom formula,
     we don't change it. However, all incomming relations become custom if they aren't.
  Note, that the returned Item is not safed via SetItem,
  but relations as in case 3 are.

  This is how we calculate the Formula for an Item in case where
  the Item has a ProofStandard, and no custom formula.
  The Formula is calculated by the following steps:
  - We build a list of all incomming relations with a bigger proofstandard.
  - We split all incomming relations in attacking and supporting ones
  - attacking and supporting relations are grouped based on their proofstandard
  - For each proofstandard all attacks from more important proofstandards cannot be defended.
    We call these ones breakers and theiy're gathered in the breakList.
  - We build a list of conditions where a single condition being true is enough
    for the item to be acceptable. Therefore these conditions are joined as a disjunction.
    - Each condition is a conjunction of some attackers, some supporters, attackers that we don't want, and a single breaker, if one exists.
    - Supportersets and attackers are choosen from their powerset.
    - In some cases it is obvious that the number of supporters doesn't outweight that of the attackers.
      In that case we don't care for the supporters and the condition becomes just, that no attacker is allowed.
