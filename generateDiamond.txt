To generate diamond input,
I'll have to get an acceptance condition
for every Item in a Discussion.

If an Item has a custom condition, we can use that.
 - But we must fit it to the Discussion, if not all
   mentioned arguments are included.

If an Item has a Proof Standard,
we'll need to perform some magic depending on the other
Items that relate to this one.
 - We can discard Attacks from Items with a lower Proof Standard.
 - Remaining Items can be grouped by PS, and for each such Group a Condition will arise
   - The Condition for such a Group will be something like 'we need as many defenders as attackers' as a logical formula
   - There will be several formulas per group
   - We'll want to build a conjunction over the formulas of a group and over the groups.
   - This can have quite some cases, but that'll be ok.
