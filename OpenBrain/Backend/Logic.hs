  Fit's a DiscussionId to an Instance.
  This means, that all necessary Articles will be autocreated
  with the given UserId as author, if they don't already exist.
  Afterwards, all Articles will get the supplied acceptance conditions
  if they have any.
  The acceptance conditions will also cause relations to be created where necessary.
  Notice that not listed Articles won't be changed, but will be kept.
  This way the given Instance is included in the Discussion,
  but possible additional stuff aswell.

  Notice that this functions can be optimized by using Data.Set instead of []
  â€¦ or even a Set from the unordered containers package
