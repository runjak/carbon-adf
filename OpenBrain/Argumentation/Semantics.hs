    An Argument a is acceptable with respect to a set s of Arguments

  {-|
    The characteristic function for acceptable,
    which delivers the set s' of all arguments that
    are acceptable with respect to a given set s of arguments.

    A set of arguments is admissible if it is conflict-free and

    A set of arguments is unattacked if there is no argument outside the set

    A set is grounded if it's a least complete set.

    A set of arguments is stable if it is conflict-free and
    all Arguments that are not in the set are attacked by the set.

  stable :: [Argument] -> af Bool
  {-|
    A set of arguments is preferred if it's a maximal admissible set.
    This means for any admissible set s that there is no argument a so
    that s with a is admissible.
