 - Get a nice Graph by using springy.js
   - Maybe with sprigy I no longer need to store positions
 - Figure out how to redesign current datatypes
   - They should support proof standards, aswell as custom conditions
   - The logic program for them must become generated
   - I'll have three kinds of relations: attack, defense, and automatically generated for a custom condition
   - I'll want to keep my algorithm to integrate an user upload
 - Maybe I can even translate the new design into the app
 - I'll want to check, if diamond can output JSON, which would greatly simplify parsing and make it more robust
 - Build a way to compose the index.html on request,
   so that it can be edited in single, smaller parts.
