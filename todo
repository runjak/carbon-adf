- Next step shall be adding interaction to resultView.
  - Later on I should bring back modals to discussions.

------------------------
- Think about reenabling some hotkeys for graph changes
- Let evaluation of discussions forward to result representation
- I think Carbon.Backend.Logic:mkFormula might need a bugfix
  - Supports from the same proof standard must be considered correctly
- Modals to edit acceptanceConditions and such in DiscussionGraphView are still missing
- isys server only has stm < 2.3, which means, that modifyTVar doesn't exist.
  - Currently the code doesn't build on the server for this reason
  - I could work around by supplying a custom modifyTVar by using templateHaskell to see if it already exists
  - Also a server update could possibly do some good
  - A copy that is compiled on my machine works on the server, which is my current workaround.
